## Developer Journey Overview

The developer experience is divided into four main stages, each supporting different aspects of software development and operations:

### 1. Onboard - "Help me get started quickly and efficiently."
- **Access Comprehensive Documentation**: Utilize TechDocs to find all necessary project documentation.
- **Unified Tool Access and Training**: Onboard onto platforms like Openshift, Vault, ELK, and more for seamless development workflows.
- **Setup Development Environment**: Automate the creation of development environments using the Scaffolder plugin.

### 2. Build - "Enable me to contribute effectively and securely."
- **Interact with Source Control and CI/CD Pipelines**: Enhance visibility and management of GitLab projects.
- **Ensure Code Quality and Security**: Use SonarQube to display code quality assessments and security scanning results.

### 3. Deploy - "Allow me to deploy reliably and understand deployment processes."
- **Manage Deployment Pipelines**: Control application deployments through GitLab directly from Backstage.

### 4. Operate - "Help me ensure that the applications I build are secure and compliant."
- **Integrate Security Testing Tools**: Monitor code quality and vulnerabilities with SonarQube.
- **Secrets Access and Audit Trails**: Manage and visualize secrets with HashiCorp Vault.
- **Log Analysis and Security Event Monitoring**: Analyze and visualize security-related logs using the ELK Stack.
- **Visibility into Kubernetes Clusters**: Monitor Kubernetes cluster metrics and health directly.
