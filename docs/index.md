## Developer Journey Overview

The developer experience is structured around the concepts of the Inner and Outer Loops, each supporting different aspects of software development and operations. These loops enhance the agility and effectiveness of development workflows, ensuring a seamless transition from development to production.

### Inner Loop: Rapid Development and Feedback

The Inner Loop focuses on activities that allow developers to build, test, and debug their applications efficiently, iterating quickly based on immediate feedback.

#### 1. Onboard - "Help me get started quickly and efficiently."
- **Access Comprehensive Documentation**: Utilize TechDocs to find all necessary project documentation.
- **Unified Tool Access and Training**: Onboard onto platforms like Openshift, Vault, ELK, and more for seamless development workflows.
- **Setup Development Environment**: Automate the creation of development environments using the Scaffolder plugin.

#### 2. Build - "Enable me to contribute effectively and securely."
- **Interact with Source Control and CI/CD Pipelines**: Enhance visibility and management of GitLab projects.
- **Ensure Code Quality and Security**: Use SonarQube to display code quality assessments and security scanning results.

### Outer Loop: Release, Monitor, and Operate

The Outer Loop encompasses the processes involved in deploying, monitoring, and operating applications in production environments, focusing on stability, security, and continuous improvement.

#### 3. Deploy - "Allow me to deploy reliably and understand deployment processes."
- **Manage Deployment Pipelines**: Control application deployments through GitLab directly from Backstage.

#### 4. Operate - "Help me ensure that the applications I build are secure and compliant."
- **Integrate Security Testing Tools**: Monitor code quality and vulnerabilities with SonarQube.
- **Secrets Access and Audit Trails**: Manage and visualize secrets with HashiCorp Vault.
- **Log Analysis and Security Event Monitoring**: Analyze and visualize security-related logs using the ELK Stack.
- **Visibility into Kubernetes Clusters**: Monitor Kubernetes cluster metrics and health directly.
